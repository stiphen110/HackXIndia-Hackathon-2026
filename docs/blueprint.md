## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted teal (#64b5cd) to inspire trust and calmness.
- Background color: Very light gray (#f0f4f7), near-white to keep the design unobtrusive and highlight content. It shares hue with the primary, and is lightly desaturated for a clean, calming feel.
- Accent color: Pale, desaturated orange (#ffb74d) for important actions and highlights, offset from the primary hue but related in its soft, muted effect.
- Headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for its blend of modernity and warmth.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', for its excellent readability and modern aesthetic.
- Use clear, universally understandable icons to represent steps, documents, and application methods.
- Mobile-first, responsive design with a clean and intuitive layout.
- Subtle, smooth transitions using Framer Motion to enhance user experience and provide feedback.
